	abstract = {Motivation: Genetic studies focus on increasingly larger genomic regions of both extant and ancient {DNA}, and there is a need for simulation software to match these technological advances. We present here a new coalescent-based simulation program fastsimcoal, which is able to quickly simulate a variety of genetic markers scattered over very long genomic regions with arbitrary recombination patterns under complex evolutionary scenarios.
Availability and Implementation: fastsimcoal is a C++ program compiled for Windows, {MacOsX} and Linux platforms. It is freely available at cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal/, together with its detailed user manual and example input files.

	abstract = {We analyse sequential Markov coalescent algorithms for populations with demographic structure: for a bottleneck model, a population-divergence model, and for a two-island model with migration. The sequential Markov coalescent method is an approximation to the coalescent suggested by {McVean} and Cardin, and by Marjoram and Wall. Within this algorithm we compute, for two individuals randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most recent common ancestor and the linkage probability corresponding to two different loci with recombination rate R between them. These quantities characterise the linkage between the two loci in question. We find that the sequential Markov coalescent method approximates the coalescent well in general in models with demographic structure. An exception is the case where individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene flow. In this situation, the correlations may be significantly underestimated. We explain why this is the case.},

However, using the model as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.},

The in silico genetic data produced by simulations, along with greater availability of population-genomics data, are transforming genetic epidemiology, anthropology, evolutionary and population genetics and conservation. In this Review of the state-of-the-art of simulation software, we identify applications of simulations, evaluate simulator capabilities, provide a guide for their use and summarize future directions.},

When the selective advantage is high, the genealogy at a locus under selective sweep can be approximated by a comb with n teeth. However, because of recombinations during the selective sweep, the hitchhiking effect decreases as the distance from the selected site increases, so that far from this locus, the tree can be approximated by a Kingman coalescent tree, as in the neutral case. We first give the distribution of the tree at a given locus. Then we focus on the evolution of this tree along the genome. Since this tree-valued process is not Markovian, we study the evolution of the Ancestral Recombination Graph along the genome in case of selective sweep.},

The algorithm traces the history of the sequences going back in time, encountering recombinations and coalescence (duplications) until the ancestral material is located on one sequence for homologous positions in the present sequences. Here an alternative algorithm is formulated not as going back in time and operating on sequences, but by moving spatially along the sequences, updating the history of the sequences as recombination points are encountered. This algorithm focuses on spatial aspects of the coalescent with recombination rather than on temporal aspects as is the case of familiar algorithms. Mathematical results related to spatial aspects of the coalescent with recombination are derived.},

Despite many years of intense interest in spatial structure, however, there are no available methods to simulate the ancestry of a sample of genes that occupy a spatial continuum. This is mainly due to the severe technical problems encountered by the classical model of isolation by distance. A recently introduced model solves these technical problems and provides a solid theoretical basis for the study of populations evolving in continuous space. We present a detailed algorithm to simulate the coalescent process in this model, and provide an efficient implementation of a generalized version of this algorithm as a freely available Python module.
