# Documentation

The documentation for scrm is automatically build from [scrm's wiki][1]. If you are
here to view or edit the documentation, best go there directly. 

## Building the documentation
In order to build the documentation, you need to install the document converter
[pandoc][2]. On Debian/Ubuntu, a simple

```bash
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

should do. Afterwards you can do a simple `make` here.
